# Deep Learning Project's Template

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to our Deep Learning Project Template, crafted for researchers and developers working with PyTorch. This template is designed to streamline the setup, execution, and modification of deep learning experiments, allowing you to focus more on model development and less on boilerplate code.

## ✨ Features

1. **Multi-GPU Support:** Utilize the power of multiple GPUs or devices to accelerate your training using [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate).
2. **Flexible Configuration:** Easily configure your experiments with the [tyro]([https:](https://github.com/brentyi/tyro)) configuration system, enabling easy to use and type validation.
3. **Clear Architecture:** Our template is structured for clarity and ease of use, ensuring you can understand and modify the code with minimal effort.
4. **Transparent Training Process:** Enjoy a clear display of the training process, helping you monitor performance and make necessary tweaks in real-time.
5. **Using uv for better and faster package management:** We adopt [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for better package management which is written in Rust.

## 📂 Folder Structure

## ⚙️ Configuration (requires update)

Configure your models and training setups with ease. Modify the `config.py` file to suit your experimental needs. Our system uses [YACS](https://github.com/rbgirshick/yacs), which allows for a hierarchical configuration with overrides for command-line options. The recommeneded structure we used:

```python
# Basic setup of the project
cfg = CN()
cfg._BASE_ = None
cfg.PROJECT_DIR = None
cfg.PROJECT_LOG_WITH = ["tensorboard"]

# Control the modeling settings
cfg.MODEL = CN()
# ...

# Control the loss settings
cfg.LOSS = CN()
# ...

# Control the dataset settings (e.g., path)
cfg.DATA = CN()
# ...

# Control the training setup (e.g., lr, epoch)
cfg.TRAIN = CN()
# ...

# Control the training setup (e.g., batch size)
cfg.EVAL = CN()
# ...
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training (requires update)

### Basic Usage

To start a training, run:

```shell
python engine.py --config configs/your_config.yaml

# Concrete example
python traing.py --config configs/cifar/cifar-small.yaml
```

After the training start, users can find the training folder called `logs`. To modify the default setting, please change the option `log_dir`. Followed by `logs` is the `project_dir` defined in the config file.

```plaintext
📦{LOG_DIR}/{PROJECT_DIR}
 ├── 📂checkpoint           # Folder for saving checkpoints 
 └── 📂...                  # Other files setup by tracker(s) 
```

### Override the config with command line

Users can override the options with the `--opts` flag. For instance, to resume the training:

```shell
python engine.py --config configs/your_config.yaml --opts TRAIN.RESUME_CHECKPOINT path/to/checkpoint

# Concrete example
python engine.py --config configs/cifar/cifar-small.yaml --opts TRAIN.RESUME_CHECKPOINT logs/cifar-small/checkpoint/best_model_epoch_10.pth
```

Please check the config setup section for more details.

### Multi-GPU Training

This project template is made based on [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) to provide multi-GPU training. A simple example to train a model with 2 GPUs:

```shell
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes=2 engine.py --config configs/your_config.json --opts (optional)

# Concrete example
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes=2 engine.py --config configs/cifar/cifar-small.json
```

### Tracker

Trackers such as `tensorboard` and `wandb` can be setup from the `project_log_with` option. We support multiple trackers at once through accelerate! Users are encouraged to find our which is the best for the project from [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/tracking). Below are some examples to open the local monitor:

```shell
# tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

## 🛠 How to Add Your Code?

1. **Integrating New Models:** Place your model files in the `modeling/` folder and update the configurations accordingly.
2. **Adding New Datasets:** Implement data handling in the `dataset/` folder and reference it in your config files.
3. **Utility Scripts:** Enhance functionality by adding utility scripts in the `utils/` folder.
4. **Customized Training Process**: Please change the `engine/engine.py` to modify the training process.

## TODO

- [ ] Support iteration based training with infinite loader.
